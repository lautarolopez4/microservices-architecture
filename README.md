# Microservices Project (Work in Progress)
This repository is a Work in Progress (WIP) project aimed at developing a microservices-based system for User Authentication using Rust.

## Overview
The Microservices Project focuses on implementing various microservices using different programming languages and frameworks to handle different aspects of a distributed application. Each microservice is designed to be independent, scalable, and efficient, allowing for easier development, deployment, and maintenance.

## Purpose
The Microservices Project aims to demonstrate the implementation of a distributed system architecture using microservices, each responsible for specific functionalities of the overall application. By developing individual services using different programming languages
and frameworks, we explore their strengths and suitability for various tasks within a distributed application environment.

# Completed Microservice
# Authentication Service (Rust):
The Authentication Service is developed using Rust, leveraging its security and performance benefits to handle user authentication efficiently and securely.
This microservice provides endpoints for user login, token generation, and authentication.

# Planned Microservices
## Task Management (Python):
Python will be used to develop the Task Management microservice, leveraging frameworks like Flask or Django.
Flask offers lightweight and flexible development, while Django provides a more comprehensive and robust structure for task management.

## Task Notifications (Node.js):
Node.js will be employed for the Task Notifications microservice due to its asynchronous I/O capabilities, ideal for sending notifications.
Express.js, a lightweight and flexible web framework, will be used to quickly build the notification service.

## Task Statistics (Java):
Java will be utilized for the Task Statistics microservice, offering scalability and performance for handling heavy workloads.
Spring Boot, a framework that simplifies Java application development, will be used to develop the statistics service.
